  <h2>The Village</h2>

  <p>Located close to the city of Corfu, Benitses appears as a small village, yet well-equipped to meet every visitor's needs. The village mainly develops along the road, offering comfort and tranquility. Among the tourist destinations of Corfu, this is one that retains the character of a traditional Greek village.</p>
  <p>There are still some old houses and fishermen at the small harbor. You can also find the ruins of an old Roman villa and Roman baths.</p>

  <h2>Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Locals are friendly and may greet you or ask about your stay, or even inquire about Sonia (my mom), Sofia (my sister), or me. Haha, don‚Äôt be surprised if someone pops into the house to say good morning!</li>
    <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Available 150 meters from the house toward the mountain, in front of the basketball court, locally called ‚ÄúDrafo.‚Äù That‚Äôs also where the municipal garbage bins are.</li>
    <li><strong>Don‚Äôt disturb the ducks.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Hiking:</strong> A 4.5 km trail starts from the parking lot near the basketball court, forming a semicircle through trees with amazing views of the village and sea. Go early in the morning to avoid the midday sun, especially on the return.</li>
    <li><strong>Coffee:</strong> Excellent everywhere.</li>
  </ul>
